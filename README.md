# Blog System Project
=====================

A simple blog system implemented using JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Overview
-----------

This project creates a basic blog system with two classes: `BlogPost` and `BlogUser`. The `BlogPost` class represents individual blog posts, while the `BlogUser` class represents users of the blog. Each user can create multiple blog posts, edit existing posts, delete the most recent post, and display all their posts.

## Features
------------

*   **BlogPost Class**: Represents individual blog posts with properties like title, content, author, and creation date.
*   **BlogUser Class**: Represents users of the blog with properties like username, full name, and an array to store their blog posts.
*   **Create Post**: Users can create new blog posts.
*   **Edit Post**: Users can edit existing blog posts.
*   **Delete Last Post**: Users can delete the most recent blog post.
*   **Display Posts**: Users can display all their blog posts.

## Usage
-----

1.  Create a new `BlogUser` instance with a unique username and full name.
2.  Use the `createPost` method to create new blog posts for the user.
3.  Use the `editPost` method to edit existing blog posts.
4.  Use the `deleteLastPost` method to delete the most recent blog post.
5.  Use the `displayPosts` method to display all blog posts created by the user.
